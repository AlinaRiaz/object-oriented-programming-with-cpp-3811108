This comprehensive course is designed to equip you with a deeper understanding of some of the core principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) and their practical application in C++ development. Instructor Károly Nyisztor shows you what it takes to master encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, while gaining hands-on experience in designing and implementing C++ classes. Explore the proper use of constructors, destructors, and member functions, as well as advanced techniques for creating flexible and reusable code through inheritance and polymorphism. Along the way, discover essential memory management strategies, including the use of smart pointers and RAII principles, to write more efficient and robust C++ programs.</p><p>This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out “Using GitHub Codespaces" with this course to learn how to get started.</p>
